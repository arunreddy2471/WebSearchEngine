The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added. Topics : Introduction Implementation Standard Problems Operations on Queue Misc Quick Links Introduction : Queue Applications of Queue Data Structure Priority Queue Applications of Priority Queue Deque Circular Queue Queue Interface In Java Queue In Python Queue In C# Implementation : Implement Queue using Stacks LRU Cache Implementation Implement Stack using Queues Queue | Set 2 (Linked List Implementation) How to efficiently implement k Queues in a single array? Implement a stack using single queue Implementation of Deque using circular array Circular Queue | Set 2 (Circular Linked List Implementation) Implement Stack and Queue using Deque Priority Queue using Linked List Priority Queue using doubly linked list Implementation of Deque using doubly linked list Standard Problems : Check if a queue can be sorted into another queue using a stack Breadth First Traversal or BFS for a Graph Level Order Tree Traversal Reverse a path in BST using queue Construct Complete Binary Tree from its Linked List Representation Program for Page Replacement Algorithms | Set 2 (FIFO) Check whether a given Binary Tree is Complete or not | Set 1 (Iterative Solution) Number of siblings of a given Node in n-ary Tree ZigZag Tree Traversal FIFO (First-In-First-Out) approach in Programming FIFO vs LIFO approach in Programming LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) approach in Programming Operations on Queue : Reversing a Queue Reversing a queue using recursion Reversing the first K elements of a Queue Interleave the first half of the queue with second half Sorting a Queue without extra space Misc : Level order traversal in spiral form Sliding Window Maximum (Maximum of all subarrays of size k) Find the largest multiple of 3 | Set 1 (Using Queue) Find the first circular tour that visits all petrol pumps Smallest multiple of a given number made of digits 0 and 9 only Iterative Method to find Height of Binary Tree Implement PriorityQueue through Comparator in Java An Interesting Method to Generate Binary Numbers from 1 to n Minimum time required to rot all oranges Find maximum level sum in Binary Tree Sum of minimum and maximum elements of all subarrays of size k.
