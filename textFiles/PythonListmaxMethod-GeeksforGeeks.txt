Python List max() Method Syntax: Syntax: max(listname) Parameter: listname : Name of list in which we have to find the maximum value. Returns : It return the maximum value present in the list. Python List max() Method Example Example 1: In this example, we are going to find the maximum integer value in the list. For that, we have to make a list of some random integers and then use the Python list max() function to find the maximum value in the list. Let’s implement this using code. Code: Python3 # Declaring a list with random integers. list1 = [4, -4, 8, -9, 1] # Store maximum value in a variable # using Python list max() function. maxValue = max(list1) # Printing value stored in maxValue. print(maxValue) Output: 8 Example 2: In this example, we are going to find the maximum value from the list of characters. This is done by following same procedure as in example 1. Python3 # Declaring a list with random integers. list1 = ['a', '$', 'e', 'E'] # Store maximum value in a variable # using Python list max() function. maxValue = max(list1) # Printing value stored in maxValue. print(maxValue) In this case of character values the max value is determined on the bases of their ASCII values. For example ASCII value of ‘e’ is 101 and ‘E’ is 69 therefore ‘e’ is larger. Output: e Example 3: In this example, we are going to try to find the maximum value from the list of mixed values such as integers and strings. Code: Python3 # Declaring a list with mixed values. list1 = ['a', '$', 'e', 3, 16] # Store maximum value in a variable # using Python list max() function. maxValue = max(list1) # Printing value stored in maxValue. print(maxValue) As we can see in the output this code gives the error because finding the maximum value between integers and string is not supported by Python list max() function. Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/b98ffbce53474d196bfb2d69e59d0873.py", line 6, in <module>
    maxValue = max(lis)
