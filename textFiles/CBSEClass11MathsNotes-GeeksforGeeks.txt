Useful Important information covered in CBSE Class 11 Chapter 5-Complex Numbers and Quadratic Equations are, Imaginary Numbers: The square root of a negative real number is called an imaginary number, e.g. √-2, √-5 etc. The quantity √-1 is an imaginary unit and it is denoted by ‘i’ called iota. i = √-1, i2 = -1, i3 = -i, i4 = 1 Equality of Complex Number: Two complex numbers z1 = x1 + iy1 and z2 = x2 + iy2 are equal, iff x1 = x2 and y1 = y2 i.e. Re(z1) = Re(z2) and Im(z1) = Im(z2) Algebra of Complex Numbers Addition: Consider z1 = x1 + iy1 and z2 = x2 + iy2 are any two complex numbers, then their sum is defined as z1 + z2 = (x1 + iy1) + (x2 + iy2) = (x1 + x2) + i (y1 + y2) Subtraction: Consider z1 = (x1 + iy1) and z2 = (x2 + iy2) are any two complex numbers, then their difference is defined as z1 – z2 = (x1 + iy1) – (x2 + iy2) = (x1 – x2) + i(y1 – y2) Multiplication: Consider z1 = (x1 + iy1) and z2 = (x2 + iy2) be any two complex numbers, then their multiplication is defined as z1z2 = (x1 + iy1) (x2 + iy2) = (x1x2 – y1y2) + i (x1y2 + x2y1) Division: Consider z1 = x1 + iy1 and z2 = x2 + iy2 be any two complex numbers, then their division is defined as Conjugate of Complex Number: Consider z = x + iy, if ‘i’ is replaced by (-i), then it is called to be conjugate of the complex number z and it is denoted by z¯, i.e. Modulus of a Complex Number: Consider z = x + iy be a complex number. So, the positive square root of the sum of square of real part and square of imaginary part is called modulus (absolute values) of z and it is denoted by |z| i.e. |z| = √x2+y2 Argand Plane: Any complex number z = x + iy can be represented geometrically by a point (x, y) in a plane, called argand plane or gaussian plane. Argument of a complex Number: The angle made by line joining point z to the origin, with the positive direction of X-axis in an anti-clockwise sense is called argument or amplitude of complex number. It is denoted by the symbol arg(z) or amp(z). arg(z) = θ = tan-1(y/x) Principal Value of Argument When x > 0 and y > 0 ⇒ arg(z) = θ When x < 0 and y > 0 ⇒ arg(z) = π – θ When x < 0 and y < 0 ⇒ arg(z) = -(π – θ) When x > 0 and y < 0 ⇒ arg(z) = -θ Polar Form of a Complex Number: When z = x + iy is a complex number, so z can be written as, z = |z| (cosθ + isinθ), where θ = arg(z). which is known as the polar form. Now, when the general value of the argument is θ, so the polar form of z is written as, z = |z| [cos (2nπ + θ) + isin(2nπ + θ)], where n is an integer.

Important points learned in CBSE Class 11 Chapter 14- Mathematical Reasoning are, Compound statement: A statement is a compound statement if it is made up of two or more smaller statements. The smaller statements are called component statements of the compound statement. The Compound statements are made by: Connectives: “AND”, “OR” Quantifiers: “there exists”, “For every” Implications: The meaning of implications “If ”, “only if ”, “ if and only if ”. “p ⇒ q” : p is a sufficient condition for q or p implies q. q is necessary to condition for p. The converse of a statement p ⇒ q is the statement q ⇒ p. p⇒ q together with its converse gives p if and only if q. “p ⇔ q”: p implies q (denoted by p ⇒ q) p is a sufficient condition for q q is a necessary condition for p p only if q ∼q implies ∼p Chapter 14 of CBSE Class 11 Maths Notes covers the following topics: Conditional Statements & Implications Validating Statements More resources for CBSE Class 11 Maths Chapter 14 Class 11 NCERT Solutions Maths Chapter 14 Class 11 RD Sharma Solutions Mathematical Reasoning All important formulas for Chapter 14 Chapter 15: Statistics Chapter 15 of Class 11 Maths is a very crucial lesson from an examination perspective.

Let S be a finite sample space with equally likely outcomes and A be the event. Therefore, the probability of an event A is: P(A) = n(A) / n(S), where n(A) is the number of elements on the set A and n(S) is the Total number of outcomes or the number of elements in the sample space S Let P and Q be any two events, then the following formulas can be derived.
