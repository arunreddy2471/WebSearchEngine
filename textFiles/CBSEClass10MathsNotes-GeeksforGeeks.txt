Let’s check the important topics in detail- Chapter 1: Real Numbers Any number, barring complex numbers, is a real number. Real numbers include positive and negative integers, irrational numbers, and fractions. To put it another way, a real number is any number found in the actual world. Numbers may be found everywhere. Natural numbers are used to count items, integers to measure temperature, rational numbers to represent fractions, and irrational numbers to calculate the square root of a number, among other things. The chapter Real numbers include both irrational and rational numbers with all natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, etc, and discuss their characteristics. Important points explained in CBSE Class 10 Chapter 1- Real Numbers are, Euclid’s Division Algorithm (lemma): According to Euclid’s Division Lemma if we have two positive integers a and b, then there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r, where 0 ≤ r ≤ b. (Here, a is the dividend, b is the divisor, q is the quotient, and r is the remainder.) Fundamental theorem of arithmetic said that the Composite Numbers are equal to the Product of Primes. HCF and LCM by prime factorization method: HCF = Product of the smallest power of each common factor in the numbers LCM = Product of the greatest power of each prime factor involved in the number HCF (a,b) × LCM (a,b) = a × b Chapter 1 of CBSE Class 10 Maths Notes covers the following topics: Euclid’s Division Algorithm Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic HCF and LCM Decimal Expansion of Rational Numbers More resources for CBSE Class 10 Maths Chapter 1 Class 10 NCERT Solutions Maths Chapter 1 Class 10 RD Sharma Solutions Real Numbers All important formulas for Chapter 1 Chapter 2: Polynomials Polynomials are algebraic expressions that consist of coefficients and variables or indeterminate.

This particular chapter presents the idea of the degree of polynomials, how a polynomial with degree 1 is a linear polynomial, degree 2 is a quadratic polynomial, and degree 3 is a cubic polynomial. Moreover, the most important topics discussed in this chapter are zeroes of a polynomial and the relationship between zeroes and coefficients of quadratic polynomials only. Some important formulas of polynomials learnt in CBSE Class 10 Chapter 2- Polynomials are, The general Polynomial Formula is, F (x) = anxn + bxn-1 + an-2xn-2 + …….. + rx + s When n is a natural number: an – bn = (a – b)(an-1 + an-2b +…+ bn-2a + bn-1) When n is even (n = 2a): xn + yn = (x + y)(xn-1 – xn-2y +…+ yn-2x – yn-1) When n is odd number: xn + yn = (x + y)(xn-1 – xn-2y +…- yn-2x + yn-1) Algebraic Polynomial Identities: (a+b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab (a-b)2 = a2 + b2 – 2ab (a+b) (a-b) = a2 – b2 (x + a)(x + b) = x2 + (a + b)x + ab (x + a)(x – b) = x2 + (a – b)x – ab (x – a)(x + b) = x2 + (b – a)x – ab (x – a)(x – b) = x2 – (a + b)x + ab (a + b)3 = a3 + b3 + 3ab(a + b) (a – b)3 = a3 – b3 – 3ab(a – b) (x + y + z)2 = x2 + y2 + z2 + 2xy + 2yz + 2xz (x + y – z)2 = x2 + y2 + z2 + 2xy – 2yz – 2xz (x – y + z)2 = x2 + y2 + z2 – 2xy – 2yz + 2xz (x – y – z)2 = x2 + y2 + z2 – 2xy + 2yz – 2xz x3 + y3 + z3 – 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x2 + y2 + z2 – xy – yz -xz) x2 + y2 =½ [(x + y)2 + (x – y)2] (x + a) (x + b) (x + c) = x3 + (a + b +c)x2 + (ab + bc + ca)x + abc x3 + y3= (x + y) (x2 – xy + y2) x3 – y3 = (x – y) (x2 + xy + y2) x2 + y2 + z2 -xy – yz – zx = ½ [(x-y)2 + (y-z)2 + (z-x)2] Division algorithm for polynomials: If p(x) and g(x) are any two polynomials with g(x) ≠ 0, then we can find polynomials q(x) and r(x) such that p(x) = q(x) × g(x) + r(x) where r(x) = 0 or degree of r(x) < degree of g(x).

The discriminant of a quadratic equation decides the nature of roots. Nature of Roots of Quadratic Equation D > 0, roots are real and distinct (unequal). D = 0, roots are real and equal (coincident) i.e. α = β = -b/2a. D < 0, roots are imaginary and unequal i.e α = (p + iq) and β = (p – iq). Where ‘iq’ is the imaginary part of a complex number.

Hence, the topics studied in this chapter will help to understand learners’ use of trigonometry. This chapter also helps to the practical concepts of trigonometry like the line of sight, angle of depression, and angle of elevation and to determine height or distance. Important terms that are explained in CBSE Class 10 Chapter 9- Some Applications of Trigonometry are, Line of Sight – The Line of Sight is the line formed by our vision as it passes through an item when we look at it. Horizontal Line – The distance between the observer and the object is measured by a horizontal line. Angle of Elevation – The angle formed by the line of sight to the top of the item and the horizontal line is called an angle of elevation. It is above the horizontal line, i.e. when we gaze up at the item, we make an angle of elevation. Angle of Depression – When the spectator must look down to perceive the item, an angle of depression is formed. When the horizontal line is above the angle, the angle of depression is formed between it and the line of sight.
