A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types: Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree. Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree. Popular Articles on Heap : Binary Heap Time Complexity of building a heap Applications of Heap Data Structure Binomial Heap Fibonacci Heap Leftist Heap K-ary Heap Heap Sort Iterative Heap Sort K’th Largest Element in an array K’th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array | Set 1 Sort an almost sorted array/ Tournament Tree (Winner Tree) and Binary Heap Check if a given Binary Tree is Heap How to check if a given array represents a Binary Heap? Connect n ropes with minimum cost Design an efficient data structure for given operations Merge k sorted arrays | Set 1 Merge Sort Tree for Range Order Statistics Sort numbers stored on different machines Smallest Derangement of Sequence Largest Derangement of a Sequence K maximum sum combinations from two arrays Maximum distinct elements after removing k elements Maximum difference between two subsets of m elements Height of a complete binary tree (or Heap) with N nodes Heap Sort for decreasing order using min heap Print all nodes less than a value x in a Min Heap. Median of Stream of Running Integers using STL Largest triplet product in a stream Find k numbers with most occurrences in the given array Convert BST to Min Heap Merge two binary Max Heaps K-th Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray Minimum product of k integers in an array of positive Integers Leaf starting point in a Binary Heap data structure Why is Binary Heap Preferred over BST for Priority Queue? Convert min Heap to max Heap Given level order traversal of a Binary Tree, check if the Tree is a Min-Heap Rearrange characters in a string such that no two adjacent are same Implementation of Binomial Heap Array Representation Of Binary Heap Sum of all elements between k1’th and k2’th smallest elements Minimum sum of two numbers formed from digits of an array K’th largest element in a stream k largest(or smallest) elements in an array | added Min Heap method Median in a stream of integers (running integers) Sort a nearly sorted (or K sorted) array Misc : Why is Binary Heap Preferred over BST for Priority Queue? Heap in C++ STL | make_heap(), push_heap(), pop_heap(), sort_heap(), is_heap, is_heap_until() Heap in Python (Using Heapq module) Where is Heap Sort used practically?
