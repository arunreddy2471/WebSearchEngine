It covers algorithm Design and Analysis process concepts. What is an Algorithm? An Algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions designed to perform a specific set of tasks. Algorithms are used in Computer science to perform calculations, automatic reasoning, data processing, computations, and problem-solving. Designing an algorithm is important before writing the program code as the algorithm explains the logic even before the code is developed.
