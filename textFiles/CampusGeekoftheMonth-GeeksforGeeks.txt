Hello Everyone, Jay Vardhan Singh, the Campus Mantri of Bennett University. It’s a pleasure to be selected as the Campus Mantri of the Month. This is just my first month with GeeksforGeeks and being selected as the Campus Geek in the first month itself is a great achievement, I would like to thank my friends and family who always support me, and everyone who has supported me in one way or the other. I would also like to thank my Mentors Divya Ma’am and Anshu Ma’am for constantly motivating and supporting me. Being a part of this community feels very great as it provides the best opportunities to connect and network with people. Being associated with GeeksforGeeks as the Campus Ambassador helped me to converse with the students of different Universities and to network with them. During this one month, I also learned the art of Time Management. We also learned how to use LinkedIn effectively and the importance of that. I also got the opportunity to interact with Sandeep Sir and it was amazing to get some career-related Advice from him. I would also like to Thank Myself for constantly believing in myself as this is the most important thing which is required to achieve anything. I am sure that this is just the beginning and there are a lot of opportunities waiting for me and I will make sure to grab them. Now I would like to end my testimonial with a quote, “You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself.” – Swami Vivekananda. Campus Geek of the month – April 2022 Name: Arpit Kumar Testimonial: “The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge but rather a lack of will. ~Vince Lombardi This is Arpit Kumar, Campus Mantri at Guru Tegh Bahadur Institute of Technology, New Delhi for the 2021-22 session. First of all, I wanna give thanks to my mentor Divya Ma’am who regularly keeps asking me for feedback like what other Mantri want from GeeksforGeeks through this program and even brings various opportunities too that could benefit us in the future also. And for selecting me as a host for the February meeting. Throughout the tenure, we learned so much from the various workshops exclusively for campus Mantri, like the LinkedIn workshop by Devanshu Monga Sir, and one of the most amazing sessions by Sandeep Jain Sir, on Stepping Stones for the Aspiring Entrepreneurs where our most common doubts were cleared. It was a fruitful experience as a Campus Mantri for GeeksforGeeks where we connected with other Mantri from different colleges all over India. We Mantri enjoyed playing with stickers haha and also shared various resources and opportunities with each other that are helpful for all of us for college studies and placements. I connected with so many great people on LinkedIn by sharing the opportunity that GFG provides. Learned marketing stuff and how to write a perfect post that reaches a wider audience. I have improved my communication skills and by sharing the opportunity, I built my personal brand on LinkedIn, by which big companies start approaching me for their promotional post. It’s rightly said that Opportunities don’t happen, you have to create them. I remember the day when I was applying for the Campus Mantri program but there I couldn’t find my college name, then I mailed to the GFG support team and within an hour, I received a response that “we have added your institution”. It was the day when I thought I had done something great! After completing one year tenure in GeeksforGeeks as a Campus Mantri, I could say that this program is for sure a great opportunity for first-year students to explore and make connections that could help them lifelong be it in getting referrals for placements, or getting guidance from any professional who is working in big MNCs and have experience.” Campus Geek of the month – March 2022 Name: Kshitij Tandon Testimonial: “Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.”– Thomas A. Edison Hello everyone, This is Kshitij Tandon, Campus Mantri GeeksforGeeks at Jaypee University of Engineering and Technology (JUET) 2021-2022. It’s my pleasure to be the Campus Mantri of the month. It’s been a long journey being a Campus Mantri in GFG. As we are heading towards getting our tenure to end which we don’t want but everything in our life has its end at some point. Like the way our journey in GFG as a campus Mantri will end soon with lots of memories, interacting with the people you never know, getting to work with the best teammates, go to enhance ourselves in every aspect in terms of work, corporate experience, how a team works, etc. We got the best mentors we can ever get Divya ma’am to be precise. She had been the best mentor to us. Always there to support us in every aspect of our work. I would like to conclude by thanking all the members of GFG for being so kind and supportive. I would conclude with the quote “Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.”– Soren Kierkegaard” Campus Geek of the month – February 2022 Name: Anushka Singh Testimonial: “One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.” – Sigmund Freud. A very warm greeting by my side! This is Anushka Singh, Campus Mantri GeeksForGeeks at Chitkara University 2021-2022. It’s been a long time since I joined GFG Community and with my ending tenure exiting with the honor of Campus Mantri of the Month is like settling with glory, and Why not GFG with the opportunity provided always taught to never settle with the basics and also not to be afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them. This program by GFG provided various exposure to me, be it professional skills, getting help in personal growth, or building my confidence. Also, I want to extend my gesture of thanks to Divya Mam, she has been a great mentor and guided me throughout, at last closing up with a saying, which goes like Success takes all forms, and so do people’s viewpoints on success, so believe in yourself, count on your cause to succeed in life, you need just two things: The first one is CONFIDENCE which I have build throughout with the help of this Program and the Second one is IGNORANCE which you have to learn on your own.” Campus Geek of the month – January 2022 Name: Sayak Mondal Testimonial: “When you do not win, make sure you learn” – G.

The journey with GfG has been about 6 months now, and it is indeed quite exhilarating and challenging. It was in the early months of my first year, when I got selected for this position. I was very excited to be working with GeeksForGeeks, but at the same time equally nervous for such a first in lifetime experience. Had not been the warm guidance of my seniors and my batchmates’ generous support; I could not imagine if I could have been such an effective part of the GfG culture at the college. The mentors and superiors at GfG who took us onboard, always have been very friendly and supportive. Never have they made me or anybody in our team feel under pressure. They understood us at a professional and personal level and made the work atmosphere light and cheerful. The Campus Mantri team is an unmatchable source of inspiration, knowledge and support. I thank all of them for such a great experience. Being an official representative of such a reputed firm, I was recognized, not just at the college but with my friends and also at other institutes. As a result of new challenges; exploring, and learning new social and technical skills became a requirement. The more I pushed my limits, the better my skills and social relations became. I am a proud member of the Geeks Community, and this journey certainly is a silver streak in my life. Being helpful to others is the highest level of satisfaction and this program has helped me earn that. Thank you for your attention.

Geeksforgeeks knows well how to appraise the CAs for their performance. This has been a huge platform for me to create a good network for myself. An appraisal of “Geek of the month” is really a huge encouragement & it not only boosts our commitment towards the organization but also encourage us to work with more commitment. Even I myself take up courses from Geeksforgeeks and participate in contests held by them. They provide a very helpful platform for the students to learn and boost up their skills.

Campus Geek of the month – November 2018 Name: Ipsita Chakraborty Testimonial: I would like to take this opportunity to thank the GeeksforGeeks team for acknowledging me and my efforts. It has been a wonderful experience so long in the Campus Ambassador Program. GeeksforGeeks has always been a saviour throughout, be it last moment studies for exams, learning competetive coding or any new language or some algorithm. Being able to work with GeeksforGeeks is the utmost pleasure for any Computer Science student and I am glad to serve the GeeksforGeeks team as a Campus Ambassador. Being a part of this program, I got to communicate with so many students in my college having keen interest in coding. They were made aware of the different opportunities that GeeksforGeeks is providing like Sudo Placement, Fork Java, Fork CPP, etc. There have also been rewards for the top performers to keep them motivated and for the campus ambassadors as well to keep up the good work. Apart from that we have got assistance from the GeeksforGeeks team in conducting coding contests in the college. All in all, the entire team is doing great work involving students from colleges across the country and reaching out to each and every individual, imparting valuable knowledge. To all the students out there, keep learning, keep growing. Happy Coding ! 😊 My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Writing code in comment?
