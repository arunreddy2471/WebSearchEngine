Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects or people called “things” that are embedded with software, electronics, network, and sensors that allows these objects to collect and exchange data. The goal of IoT is to extend the internet connectivity from standard devices like computer, mobile, tablet to relatively dumb devices like a toaster. IoT virtually makes everything “smart” by improving aspects of our life with the power of data collection, AI algorithms, and networks. An IoT example can be a person with a diabetes monitor implant, an animal with tracking devices, etc. 👉 What are the examples of IoT devices which are currently available in the market? Here are examples of IoT devices that are currently used: Smart bulbs Door sensors Voice controller Smart lock Smart Plug Security system ⚡ How IoT works? The entire IoT process starts with the devices themselves like smartphones, smartwatches, and electronic appliances like TV or washing machines are connected through the Internet, which helps to communicate with the IoT platform. Here are four fundamental components of an IoT system: 1) Sensors/Devices: Sensors or devices are a key component that helps you to collect live data from the surrounding environment. All this data may have various levels of complexities. It could be a simple temperature monitoring sensor, or it may be in the form of a video feed. This type of device has various types of sensors that perform multiple tasks apart from sensing. 2) Connectivity: All the collected data is sent to a cloud infrastructure. The sensors should be connected to the cloud using various mediums of communication. These communication mediums include mobile or satellite networks, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. 3) Data Processing: Once the data is collected and gets to the cloud, the software performs processing on the gathered data. These processes can be just checking the temperature, reading on devices like AC or heaters. However, it can also be complex, like identifying objects, using computer vision on video, and many other critical processes. 4) User Interface: The information needs to be available to the end-user in some way, which can be achieved by triggering alarms on their phones or sending them notifications through email or a text message. Sometimes, the user who uses an IoT device might need an interface that actively checks their IoT system. For example, the user has a camera installed in his home, and he wants to access video recordings and all the feeds to his computer with the help of a web server. 🏅 What are IoT devices? IoT devices listed above are types of hardware, such as appliances, sensors, machines, gadgets, or actuators, which are programmed for particular applications and can transmit data over the network or internet. These devices can be embedded into other industrial equipment, environmental sensors, mobile devices, medical devices, and more. 🚀 Where IoT devices can be used? Here are the sectors where IoT devices can be used: Consumer Products: It can be kitchen appliances, smartwatches, security cameras, light bulbs, home assistance, etc. Industrial Use: It includes pumps, carts, washing machines, etc. Infrastructure: This involves IoT devices for smart buildings and highways. Logistics: IoT devices can be used to move cargo from one place to another. Connectivity: IoT devices can help you to group multiple devices together. ❗ What is smart home technology? Smart home technology is a term refers to basic home facilities with a communication technology that provides either remote control access or automation. Smart home technology can help you to manage everything from temperature and lights to door locks & security devices just from your devices like mobile phone or tablet. It also enables IoT devices to be used with just a voice command or click of a button.
