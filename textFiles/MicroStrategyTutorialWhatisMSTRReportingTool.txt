Various Objects in MicroStrategy Configuration Objects In Microstrategy, Object appears in the system layer for use in multiple projects. It includes configuration objects such as Schedules, Data Warehouse, and Login ID. Schema Objects They are used for the logical representation of structures in Data Warehouse. This type of objects acts as a building block for BI. This helps you to map columns in database, functions, and operations. Report Objects This objects layer helps you to assembles the building blocks from the Schema and Analysis. It provides insightful textual and visual analysis. Public Objects Helps users to access the project and create objects to store them in personal folders during the project. Non-Administrative users can only view objects on the public folder so you can’t delete or create new objects in public folders. For example, Drill Maps, Documents, Templates and searches, Metrics.
