There are two-dimensional forms and three-dimensional shapes in Euclidean geometry. Flat shapes are two shapes in plane geometry that include triangles, squares, rectangles, and circles. 3D forms such as a square, cuboid, cone, and so on are also known as solids in solid geometry. The fundamental geometry is based on points, lines, and planes, as described in coordinate geometry. The various forms of shapes in geometry help us understand the shapes we see in our daily lives. We can measure the field, circumference, and volume of shapes using geometric principles. Table of Content Plane Geometry Solid Geometry Plane Geometry Plane geometry is concerned with platforms that can be drawn on paper. Lines, circles, and triangles in two dimensions are examples. Plane geometry is another name for two-dimensional geometry. All two-dimensional figures have only two dimensions: length and width. It does not take into account the depth of the shapes. Plane figures have squares, triangles, rectangles, circles, and so on. Any of the most essential terms in plane geometry are described here in the below articles: Polygons and its types Measures of the Exterior Angles of a Polygon Rectangle, Square, Rhombus, Parallelogram Some Special Parallelograms Basic terms and definitions Pairs of Angles Parallel lines and a transversal Lines parallel to the same line and Angle Sum Property Properties of triangles Angle Sum Property of a Triangle Inequalities in a triangle Theorem – Angle opposite to equal sides of an isosceles triangle are equal Angle sum property of a quadrilateral Types of quadrilateral Properties of Parallelograms MidPoint Theorem Rhombus Kite – Quadrilaterals Area of 2D Shapes Figures on the same base and between the same parallels Circles and its Related Terms Circle Theorems Theorem – There is one and only one circle passing through three given non-collinear points Theorem – The sum of opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 180° Inscribed Shapes in a Circle Basic Construction Construction of Triangles Construction of a Quadrilateral Euclid’s Definitions, Axioms, and Postulates Equivalent version of Euclid’s Fifth postulate Euclid’s Division Algorithm Properties of Triangles Construction of Similar Triangles Similar Triangles Pythagoras Theorem and it’s Converse Thales’s Theorem Criteria for Similarity of Triangles Congruence of Triangles Solid Geometry Solid geometry is concerned with three-dimensional structures such as cubes, prisms, cylinders, and spheres. It is concerned with the figure’s three dimensions, which are length, width, and height. However, certain solids do not have faces (e.g. sphere). The analysis of three dimensions in Euclidean space is known as solid geometry. The structures of our environment are three-dimensional. Both three-dimensional shapes are created by rotating two-dimensional shapes. Faces, corners, and vertices are essential characteristics of 3D forms. Examine these words in depth for various geometric forms here in the following articles: Visualizing Solid Shapes Mapping Space Around Us Cartesian Coordinate System Cartesian Plane Coordinate Geometry Distance formula Section formula Mid-point Formula Area of a Triangle Tangent to a circle Tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact Number of Tangents from a point on a circle Lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal Division of Line Segment in Given Ratio Construction of tangents to a circle Perimeter of circular figures, Areas of sector and segment of a circle & Areas of combination of plane figures Coordinate Axes and Coordinate Planes in 3D Distance Formula & Section Formula Slope of a Straight Line Introduction to Two-Variable Linear Equations in Straight Lines Forms of Two-Variable Linear Equations of a line Point-slope Form Slope-Intercept Form of Straight Lines Writing Slope-Intercept Equations Standard Form of a Straight Line x-intercepts and y-intercepts of a Line Graphing slope-intercept equations Direction Cosines and Direction Ratios of a Line Equation of a Line in 3D Angle between two lines Shortest Distance Between Two Lines in 3D Space Points, Lines, and Planes Linear Programming Graphical Solution of Linear Programming Problems My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Like Next Theorem - The lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal - Circles | Class 10 Maths Recommended Articles Page : What is a plane in geometry? 30, Nov 21 Class 9 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 5 Introduction to Euclid's Geometry - Exercise 5.2 25, Dec 20 Section formula – Internal and External Division | Coordinate Geometry 25, Oct 20 Class 10 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 14 Coordinate Geometry - Exercise 14.5 | Set 3 02, May 21 Mid-point Formula in Coordinate Geometry 23, Oct 20 Distance formula - Coordinate Geometry | Class 10 Maths 25, Oct 20 Area of a Triangle - Coordinate Geometry | Class 10 Maths 25, Oct 20 Class 8 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 4 Practical Geometry - Exercise 4.1 02, Nov 20 Class 8 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 4 Practical Geometry - Exercise 4.3 02, Nov 20 Class 9 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 3 Coordinate Geometry - Exercise 3.3 08, Nov 20 Class 9 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 3 Coordinate Geometry - Exercise 3.1 08, Nov 20 Class 9 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 3 Coordinate Geometry - Exercise 3.2 10, Nov 20 Class 8 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 4 Practical Geometry - Exercise 4.5 17, Nov 20 Class 8 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 4 Practical Geometry - Exercise 4.4 10, Dec 20 Class 8 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 4 Practical Geometry - Exercise 4.2 10, Dec 20 Class 9 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 7 Introduction to Euclid’s Geometry- Exercise 7.1 09, Dec 20 Class 11 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 12 Introduction to three dimensional Geometry - Exercise 12.1 13, Dec 20 Class 11 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 12 Introduction to three dimensional Geometry - Exercise 12.3 18, Dec 20 Class 11 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 12 Introduction to three dimensional Geometry - Exercise 12.2 18, Dec 20 Class 11 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 28 Introduction to 3D Coordinate Geometry - Exercise 28.1 21, Dec 20 Distance Formula & Section Formula - Three-dimensional Geometry 18, Jan 21 Class 9 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 5 Introduction to Euclid's Geometry - Exercise 5.1 28, Dec 20 Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 18 Practical Geometry - Exercise 18.5 11, Jan 21 Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions- Chapter 18 Practical Geometry - Exercise 18.1 11, Jan 21 Article Contributed By : GeeksforGeeks Vote for difficulty Easy Normal Medium Hard Expert Improved By : anjalishukla1859 Article Tags : Class 10 Class 11 Class 12 Class 8 Class 9 School Learning School Mathematics Report Issue Writing code in comment?
