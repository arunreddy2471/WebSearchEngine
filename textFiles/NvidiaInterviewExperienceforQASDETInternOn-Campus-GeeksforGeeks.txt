Hackerrank test consists of 2 coding problems, OS, computer fundamental, and logical reasoning. Shortlisted about 16-20 students. The interview duration was 1 Hr. there were two interviewers on MS Teams. One was asking CPP questions and the other was asking python Questions were based on Project What is the difference between lemming vs stemming What are things from NLP you used?
