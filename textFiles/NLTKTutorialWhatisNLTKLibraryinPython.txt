ByDaniel Johnson Hours UpdatedJuly 16, 2022 What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)? Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a process of manipulating or understanding the text or speech by any software or machine. An analogy is that humans interact and understand each otherâ€™s views and respond with the appropriate answer. In NLP, this interaction, understanding, and response are made by a computer instead of a human. What is NLTK? NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) Library is a suite that contains libraries and programs for statistical language processing. It is one of the most powerful NLP libraries, which contains packages to make machines understand human language and reply to it with an appropriate response.

Before learning this NLTK Python tutorial, it is advised for the learners to have the basic knowledge of Artificial Intelligence, Python Programming concepts, and English grammar. Who is this NLTK Tutorial for? This Python NLTK tutorial is for students who have an interest in learning Natural Language Processing. This guide will also help the working professionals to enhance their knowledge about NLP. Various NLP Libraries NLP Library Description NLTK This is one of the most usable and mother of all NLP libraries. spaCy This is a completely optimized and highly accurate library widely used in deep learning Stanford CoreNLP Python For client-server-based architecture, this is a good library in NLTK. This is written in JAVA, but it provides modularity to use it in Python. TextBlob This is an NLP library which works in Pyhton2 and python3. This is used for processing textual data and provide mainly all type of operation in the form of API. Gensim Genism is a robust open source NLP library support in Python. This library is highly efficient and scalable. Pattern It is a light-weighted NLP module. This is generally used in Web-mining, crawling or such type of spidering task. p Polyglot For massive multilingual applications, Polyglot is best suitable NLP library. Feature extraction in the way on Identity and Entity. PyNLPl PyNLPI also was known as â€˜Pineappleâ€™ and supports Python. It provides a parser for many data formats like FoLiA/Giza/Moses/ARPA/Timbl/CQL. Vocabulary This library is best to get Semantic type information from the given text. In this NLTK tutorial in Python, we will only discuss one of the most popular NLP library NLTK.
