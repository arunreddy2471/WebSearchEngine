The size of data sets being collected and analyzed in the industry for business intelligence is growing and in a way, it is making traditional data warehousing solutions more expensive. Hadoop with MapReduce framework, is being used as an alternative solution for analyzing data sets with huge size. Though, Hadoop has proved useful for working on huge data sets, its MapReduce framework is very low level and it requires programmers to write custom programs which are hard to maintain and reuse. Hive comes here for rescue of programmers. Hive engine compiles these queries into Map-Reduce jobs to be executed on Hadoop. In addition, custom Map-Reduce scripts can also be plugged into queries. Hive operates on data stored in tables which consists of primitive data types and collection data types like arrays and maps. Hive comes with a command-line shell interface which can be used to create tables and execute queries. Hive query language is similar to SQL wherein it supports subqueries. With Hive query language, it is possible to take a MapReduce joins across Hive tables. It has a support for simple SQL like functionsâ€“ CONCAT, SUBSTR, ROUND etc., and aggregation functionsâ€“ SUM, COUNT, MAX etc. It also supports GROUP BY and SORT BY clauses. It is also possible to write user defined functions in Hive query language. What is Hive? Apache Hive is a data warehouse framework for querying and analysis of data stored in HDFS. It is developed on top of Hadoop. Hive is an open-source software to analyze large data sets on Hadoop. It provides SQL-like declarative language, called HiveQL, to express queries. Using Hive-QL, users associated with SQL can perform data analysis very easily. Hive Vs Map Reduce Prior to choosing one of these two options, we must look at some of their features. While choosing between Hive and Map reduce following factors are taken in consideration; Type of Data Amount of Data Complexity of Code Hive Vs Map Reduce? Feature Hive Map Reduce Language It Supports SQL like query language for interaction and for Data modeling It compiles language with two main tasks present in it. One is map task, and another one is a reducer. We can define these task using Java or Python Level of abstraction Higher level of Abstraction on top of HDFS Lower level of abstraction Efficiency in Code Comparatively lesser than Map reduce Provides High efficiency Extent of code Less number of lines code required for execution More number of lines of codes to be defined Type of Development work required Less Development work required More development work needed Click for the Next Tutorial Post navigation Report a Bug Next Continue Top Tutorials About About Us Advertise with Us Write For Us Contact Us Python Testing Hacking Career Suggestion SAP Career Suggestion Tool Software Testing as a Career Interesting eBook Blog Quiz SAP eBook SAP Java SQL Execute online Execute Java Online Execute Javascript Execute HTML Execute Python Selenium Cryptocurrency VPNs Â© Copyright - Guru99 2022 Privacy Policy | Affiliate Disclaimer | ToS Scroll to top Home TestingExpand child menu Expand Agile Testing JUnit Quality Center(ALM) Bugzilla HP Loadrunner RPA Cucumber Software Testing SAP Testing Database Testing Mobile Testing Selenium ETL Testing Mantis SoapUI JMeter Postman TEST Management JIRA QTP TestLink SAPExpand child menu Expand ABAP CRM PI/PO APO Crystal Reports PP Beginners FICO SD Basis HANA SAPUI5 BODS HR Security Tutorial BI/BW MM Solution Manager BPC QM Successfactors CO Payroll SAP Tutorial WebExpand child menu Expand Apache Java PHP SQL Server AngularJS JSP PL/SQL UML ASP.NET Kotlin PostgreSQL VB.NET C Linux Python VBScript C# MariaDB ReactJS Web Services C++ MS Access Ruby & Rails WPF CodeIgniter MySQL Scala SQLite DBMS Node.js SQL Perl JavaScript Must LearnExpand child menu Expand Accounting Embedded Systems Operating System Algorithms Ethical Hacking PMP Android Excel Tutorial Photoshop Blockchain Go Programming Project Management Business Analyst IoT Reviews Build Website ITIL Salesforce Cloud Computing Jenkins SEO COBOL MIS Software Engineering Compiler Design Movie VBA Courses Networking VPN Big DataExpand child menu Expand AWS Hive Power BI Big Data Informatica Qlikview Cassandra MicroStrategy Tableau Cognos MongoDB Talend Data Warehousing NiFi ZooKeeper DevOps OBIEE Pentaho HBase Live ProjectExpand child menu Expand Live Agile Testing Live Selenium Project Live HP ALM Live Selenium 2 Live Java Project Live Security Testing Live Mobile Testing Live Testing Project Live Payment Gateway Live Testing 2 Live PHP Project Live Telecom Live Projects Hub Live UFT/QTP Testing Live Python Project Live SEO Project AIExpand child menu Expand Artificial Intelligence PyTorch Data Science R Programming Keras TensorFlow NLTK Blog Toggle Menu Close Search for: Searchhttps://www.guru99.com/hive-tutorials.html Hive Tutorial for Beginners: Learn with Examples in 3 Days Skip to content Home Testing Expand Agile Testing JUnit Quality Center(ALM) Bugzilla HP Loadrunner RPA Cucumber Software Testing SAP Testing Database Testing Mobile Testing Selenium ETL Testing Mantis SoapUI JMeter Postman TEST Management JIRA QTP TestLink SAP Expand ABAP CRM PI/PO APO Crystal Reports PP Beginners FICO SD Basis HANA SAPUI5 BODS HR Security Tutorial BI/BW MM Solution Manager BPC QM Successfactors CO Payroll SAP Tutorial Web Expand Apache Java PHP SQL Server AngularJS JSP PL/SQL UML ASP.NET Kotlin PostgreSQL VB.NET C Linux Python VBScript C# MariaDB ReactJS Web Services C++ MS Access Ruby & Rails WPF CodeIgniter MySQL Scala SQLite DBMS Node.js SQL Perl JavaScript Must Learn Expand Accounting Embedded Systems Operating System Algorithms Ethical Hacking PMP Android Excel Tutorial Photoshop Blockchain Go Programming Project Management Business Analyst IoT Reviews Build Website ITIL Salesforce Cloud Computing Jenkins SEO COBOL MIS Software Engineering Compiler Design Movie VBA Courses Networking VPN Big Data Expand AWS Hive Power BI Big Data Informatica Qlikview Cassandra MicroStrategy Tableau Cognos MongoDB Talend Data Warehousing NiFi ZooKeeper DevOps OBIEE Pentaho HBase Live Project Expand Live Agile Testing Live Selenium Project Live HP ALM Live Selenium 2 Live Java Project Live Security Testing Live Mobile Testing Live Testing Project Live Payment Gateway Live Testing 2 Live PHP Project Live Telecom Live Projects Hub Live UFT/QTP Testing Live Python Project Live SEO Project AI Expand Artificial Intelligence PyTorch Data Science R Programming Keras TensorFlow NLTK Blog Search Toggle Menu Hive Tutorial for Beginners: Learn with Examples in 3 Days ByDavid Taylor Hours UpdatedJune 18, 2022 Hive Tutorial Summary Apache Hive helps with querying and managing large datasets real fast.
