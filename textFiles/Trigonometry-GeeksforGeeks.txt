Algebra HTML Forms Trigonometry View Discussion Improve Article Save Article Like Article Difficulty Level : Medium Last Updated : 30 May, 2022 Hipparchus, a Greek mathematician, introduced the idea of trigonometry, which is one of the most important branches of mathematics. Trigonometry is basically applicable to the Right-angled triangle. In this article, we’ll look at the relationship between the sides and angles of a right-angled triangle. The fundamentals of trigonometry describe six functions: sin, cos, tan, sec, cosec, and cot. Trigonometry uses trigonometric ratios (which is the ratio of two sides of the triangle)to determine the angles and incomplete sides of a triangle. Angles are measured in either radians or degrees. Angles in trigonometry that are widely used are 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, 15 °, and 18°. Table of Contents Basic Trigonometry Inverse Trigonometry Applications of Trigonometry Basic Trigonometry Basic Trigonometry covers, tangent, sine, and cosine these are the names given to the three ratios. It can then be expanded to include other ratios and trigonometry in the Cartesian Plane. These trigonometry studies will cover the following topics: Trigonometry in the Cartesian Plane, Graphs of Trigonometric Functions, and Trigonometric Identities are all topics covered in this course. Following are the articles that cover all the topics the same: Introduction to Trigonometric Ratios of a Triangle Trigonometric Ratios of Some Specific Angles Reciprocal of Trigonometric Ratios Trigonometric Identities Measurement of Angles Trigonometric Functions Trigonometric Functions of Sum and Difference of Two Angles Inverse Trigonometry Inverse trigonometric functions are essentially the inverse functions of the fundamental trigonometric functions sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant. These functions are also known as arcs functions, anti-trigonometric functions, and cyclometer functions. These trigonometry inverse functions are used to calculate the angle for each of the trigonometry ratios. In physics, mechanics, geometry, and navigation, inverse trigonometry functions are widely used. Basic Concepts Graphs of Inverse Trigonometric Functions Properties of Inverse Trigonometric Functions Inverse Trigonometric Identities Applications of Trigonometry Trigonometry is used to calculate the height of a structure or a mountain. Using trigonometric functions, the distance of a structure from the perspective and the elevation angle can easily calculate the height of a building. It does not have particular applications in solving functional problems, but it is used in a variety of fields. For example, trigonometry is used in the development of computer music: as you might know, sound moves in the form of waves, and this wave pattern is used in the development of computer music by passing it through a sine or cosine function.
