It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. Working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL. STL has 4 components: Click here for the Complete Course! Algorithms Containers Functions Iterators Algorithms The header algorithm defines a collection of functions specially designed to be used on a range of elements. They act on containers and provide means for various operations for the contents of the containers. Algorithm Sorting Searching Important STL Algorithms Useful Array algorithms Partition Operations Numeric valarray class Containers Containers or container classes store objects and data. There are in total seven standards “first-class” container classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven header files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors. Sequence Containers: implement data structures that can be accessed in a sequential manner. vector list deque arrays forward_list( Introduced in C++11) Container Adaptors: provide a different interface for sequential containers. queue priority_queue stack Associative Containers: implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity). set multiset map multimap Unordered Associative Containers: implement unordered data structures that can be quickly searched unordered_set (Introduced in C++11) unordered_multiset (Introduced in C++11) unordered_map (Introduced in C++11) unordered_multimap (Introduced in C++11) Functions The STL includes classes that overload the function call operator. Instances of such classes are called function objects or functors. Functors allow the working of the associated function to be customized with the help of parameters to be passed. Functors Iterators As the name suggests, iterators are used for working upon a sequence of values. They are the major feature that allows generality in STL. Iterators Utility Library Defined in header <utility>. pair To master C++ Standard Template Library (STL) in the most efficient and effective way, do check out this C++ STL Online Course by GeeksforGeeks. The course covers the basics of C++ and in-depth explanations to all C++ STL containers, iterators, etc along with video explanations of a few problems. Also, you’ll learn to use STL inbuilt classes and functions in order to implement some of the complex data structures and perform operations on them conveniently. Recent Articles on STL!
