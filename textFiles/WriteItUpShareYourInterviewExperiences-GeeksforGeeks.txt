Guidelines to write an Interview Experience? Follow these guidelines to write the Interview Experience – https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-interview-experience/ For example: If you are writing an SDE interview experience, you must precisely focus on the subject the interview was conducted around, which is DSA in most cases and try to cover all questions based on it. You need to mention the company’s name and the position you applied for in the title and then share about the various rounds that are conducted along with round-specific questions. You are free to write your side of the story with good or bad parts. As a reference, you can check these Interview experiences, and that is how you can start writing your experiences and help others to achieve their dream job, internship or course.
