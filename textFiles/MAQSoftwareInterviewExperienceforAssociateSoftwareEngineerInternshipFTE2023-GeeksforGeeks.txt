The written round was 1hr30 min and the level of the written test was quite high. There were 12 sections in the first round which comprised of 4 coding questions 3aptitude sections(easy medium difficult) Oops section DSMS puzzle solving I do not remember the exact coding questions but all of them were quite hard. In the first round out of 520 only 120 were able to clear the first round Round 2(Technical interview): The interview started in the morning itself only. The time duration of the interview was of 30 minutes In that 30 min he asked some questions regarding the project and all the concepts regarding DBMS oops os In the last 15 minutes he gave me a coding question to code which was quite hard for me but somehow was able to code it Even some of my friends just asked SQL queries in 30 minutes In the technical round out of 123 students only 17 students were qualified for the next round Round 3(Technical+HR): The next morning the round began, It was around 40-50 minutes In this round technical was the main focus They asked me to code a problem that I don’t remember exactly. But it was a tough problem. Then they asked too much from the DSA SQL projects that I got grilled. Next the HR round began and he asked me basics HR questions OVERALL THE HR ROUND WENT WELL BUT THE TECHNICAL WAS QUITE HARD.SO I WAS UNABLE TO CLEAR THE INTERVIEW. Only 6 students qualified and the rest were out. So prepare nicely for this company interview.
