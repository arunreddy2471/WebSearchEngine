Python Programming Characteristics It provides rich data types and easier to read syntax than any other programming languages It is a platform-independent scripted language with full access to operating system API’s Compared to other programming languages, it allows more run-time flexibility It includes the basic text manipulation facilities of Perl and Awk A module in Python may have one or more classes and free functions Libraries in Pythons are cross-platform compatible with Linux, Macintosh, and Windows For building large applications, Python can be compiled to byte-code Python supports functional and structured programming as well as OOP It supports interactive mode that allows interacting Testing and debugging of snippets of code In Python, since there is no compilation step, editing, debugging, and testing are fast. Applications of Python Programming Language Program video games Build Artificial Intelligence algorithms Program various scientific programs such as statistical models Python vs JAVA vs Perl vs TCL vs PHP vs RUBY vs C++ vs JavaScript Python is one of the most popular programming languages. Currently, each of the following six languages are being used by programmers for developing both desktop and web applications. That is why, it is important for programmers to compare Python with JAVA, Perl , TCL, PHP, RUBY, C++, and JavaScript to pick the right language for their projects. Programming Languages Difference Between Python and Other Languages Java Python takes less time to develop, although it is expected to run slower than Java programs Due to Python high-level data types and its dynamic typing programs are shorter than Java programs Perl Although both these languages are considered similar in many ways, Perl supports common application-oriented tasks like report generating, file scanning, etc. while Python supports for common programming methodologies like data structure design and OOPs programming for programmers making language to readable code Tcl Tcl is a standalone programming language it is considered weak on data structures It is slower in executing code compared to Python PHP Python has easy to read code while PHP has more syntax from C/C++ and Perl In Python, classes are used extensively in the standard library, while PHP has SPL which is fully class-based Python supports structured exception handling while most PHP functions do not use exceptions for reporting errors Development features in Python are provided by an add-on, while in PHP it is built in Python supports major GUI frameworks RUBY Compare to Ruby, Python has a rich set of data structures, internal functions, better namespace handling and use of modules and iterators Python supports multiple inheritance while Ruby does not. To close all its scopes, Ruby requires “end” or “}” while Python uses the white space only. RUBY is preferred for Web development and functional programming, while Python is for Academic and scientific programming. Ruby work on “Do more with less.” Philosophy while PYTHON “One right way to do things.” C++ Python code is quite shorter than most other programming languages like C or C++. Python is a dynamically typed language, while C++ is a statically typed language. JavaScript Python is server side. JavaScript is client side. Python uses indentation and whitespace. JavaScript uses curly brackets to designate blocks of code. In these Python tutorials, we will cover Python 2 and Python 3 Examples.
