This allows the organization to develop an environment to easily work with Apache Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL databases for cloud or on-premises jobs. Today many companies are using Hadoop for cost saving and performance improvement. Often companies using expensive compute time with the enterprise solutions. With Hadoop, data can be transformed cleansed and enriched and integrated for the higher analytical workload. The Talend Sandbox includes four use cases Data Warehouse Optimization Clickstream Analytics Social Media Sentiment Analysis Apache weblog analytics. You can create your own complex Use Cases. Benefits Talend for Big data Hadoop Improve the efficiency of the big data job design by arranging and configuring in a graphical interface. Adds data quality, scalability, and management functions MapReduce feature allows faster parallel data processing Shared Repository and remote deployment Data quality and profiling with Data Cleansing Improves efficiency of big data job design with GUI interface Native support for HBase, HDFS, Hive, Sqoop, Mahout, & Pig Embedded in Hortonworks Data Platform Data Integration: Talend data integration software tool has an open, scalable architecture. It allows faster response to business requests. The tool offers to develop and deploy data integration jobs faster than hand coding. It allows you to easily integrate all your data with other data warehouses or synchronize data between systems. Data integration involves combining data stored in different sources and providing users with a unified view of these data. It helps you to manage various ETL jobs, and empower users with simple, self-service data preparation. Benefits Talend for Data Integration Agile Integration: Respond faster to business requests without writing code using over 1000 out-of-the-box connectors, Eclipse-based graphical tools, and an optimized-for-performance code generator. Team Productivity: Collaborate using powerful versioning, impact analysis, testing and debugging, and metadata management. Easy management: The tool offers advanced scheduling and monitoring features. It provides real-time data integration with dashboards and centralized control for fast deployment across multiple nodes. Stay ahead in the competition: If you use this tool, you will not have to wait for using the latest and coolest data integration features. Pay the lowest price for ownership: Talend tool offers subscription-based pricing model. You need to pay for the number of developers using Talend Studio thereby saving you money compared to flat licensing. Integration Cloud: You can accelerate the cloud and on-premises data integration projects by using highly scalable and secure cloud integration platform-as-a-service (iPaaS). Talend integration cloud tool offers connectivity, built-in data quality, and native code generation. Talend is secured cloud integration platform which allows IT and business users to connect shared both could and on-premise. It unlocks the power of cloud design job as it can manage, monitor, and control in the cloud. Next in this Talend tutorial with examples, we will learn about benefits of Talend integration cloud over other tools. Integration cloud benefits Talend Integration Cloud Other Tools 900+ drag-n-drop components Hand coding which is unproductive Generates optimized code Need specialized skills Collaboration & management Hard to maintain Gold support (SLAs) Limited support What is Talend Open Studio? Talend Open Studio is an open architecture for data integration, data profiling, big data, cloud integration and more. It is a GUI environment that offers more than 1000 pre-built connectors. This makes it easy to perform operations like transform files, load data, move and rename files. It allows each component to define complex processes. Integration jobs are created from Talend components that are configured instead of coded. Moreover, jobs can be run from within the development environment, or it can be executed as standalone scripts. Benefits of Using Talend Open studio: It reduces the time taken to develop integration from weeks and months to days or even hours. It converts and updates data present from various sources. Monitor and manage difficult deployments with ease You can have the lowest cost of ownership of any solution Talend Open Source can easily combine, convert and update data present from various sources. Talend Open Source tool Inherits potential power of programming platform. Wide selection of source/target connectors makes it best choice across the industry. Comes with strong capability of multi schema log file/reconciliation report (post data flow/migration) Legacy ETL Talend Propriety Engine Open Hard to scale Big Data Generates native code Expensive Low TCO Talend Open Studio- Architecture: Now in this Talend Open Studio tutorial, we will learn about Talend open studio architecture. Following are the 3 key components of Talend Open Studio Architecture Talend Open Studio Architecture Clients: The Clients block includes one or more Talend Studio(s) and Web browsers which uses same or different machines. Talend Studio allows you to perform data integration processes irrespective of the level of data volumes and process complexity. Talend Server: The Talend server is another important block which includes a web-based application server. It enables the administration and maintenance of all projects. It includes user accounts, access rights, and project authorization in the Administration database. Database: The Databases component includes the Administration, the Audit and the Monitoring of databases. This component helps to manage user accounts, access rights, and project authorization. The Audit database helps to evaluate different aspects of the Jobs for developing an ideal process-oriented decision support system. Workspace: In Talend, a workspace is a directory where you store all project folders. However, for that, you will require at least one workspace directory per connection (repository connection). Talend allows connecting with various workspace directories in case if you donâ€™t want to use the default directories. Repository: A repository is the storage area which TOS tool uses to gather data to explain business models or to design Jobs.
