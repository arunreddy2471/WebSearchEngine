Static Data Structure vs Dynamic Data Structure Static and Dynamic data structures in Java with Examples Common operations on various Data Structures Real-time application of Data Structures Array Data Structure Last Updated : 07 Jul, 2022 Data Structure and Algorithms Course Practice Problems on Arrays Recent articles on Arrays An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array). The above image can be looked as a top-level view of a staircase where you are at the base of the staircase. Each element can be uniquely identified by their index in the array (in a similar way as you could identify your friends by the step on which they were on in the above example).
