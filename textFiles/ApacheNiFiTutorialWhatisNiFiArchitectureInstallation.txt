Architecture & Installation ByDavid Taylor Hours UpdatedJune 18, 2022 Apache NiFi Tutorial Summary This apache NiFi tutorial covers all the basic to advanced topics from scratch. You will learn the concepts like NiFi definition, history, architecture, features, installation process, use cases. You will also learn why you need to use apache NiFi and the best practices of running apache NiFi. What is Apache NiFi? Apache NiFi is an open source software for automating and managing the data flow between systems. It is a powerful and reliable system to process and distribute data. It provides web-based User Interface to create, monitor, and control data flows. It has a highly configurable and modifiable data flow process to modify data at runtime. Apache NiFi is easily extensible through the development of custom components. In this Apache NiFi tutorial, you will learn- What is Apache NiFi? Why Use Apache NIfi? History of Apache NiFi NiFi Architecture Apache NiFi Features How to Install Apache NiFi Nifi Use Cases Best practices Running Apache NiFi Disadvantage of Nifi Why Use Apache NIfi? Here, are reasons for using Apache Nifi: Allows you to do data ingestion to pull data into NiFi, from numerous data sources and create flow files It offers real-time control which helps you to manage the movement of data between any source & destination Visualize DataFlow at the enterprise level Provide common tooling and extensions Allows you to take advantage of existing libraries and Java ecosystem functionality Helps organizations to integrate Nifi with their existing infrastructure NiFi is designed to scale-out in clusters which offer guaranteed delivery of data Visualize and Monitor performance, behavior in a flow bulletin which offers insight and inline documentation Helps you to start and stop components separately or at the group level It helps you to listen, fetch, split, aggregate, route, transform and drag & drop Dataflow History of Apache NiFi Developed at NSA for over eight years 2014- It was donated to the Apache Software Foundation 2015- NiFi became an official part of the Apache Project Suite Since then every 6-8 weeks, Apache NiFi releases a new update NiFi Architecture Apache NiFi has a well-thought-out architecture. Once data is fetched from external sources, it is represented as FlowFile inside Apache NiFi architecture. NiFi Architecture Here are key components of NiFi architecture Nifi Component Description FlowFile FlowFile is original data with meta-information attached to it. It allows you to process not only CSV or other record-based data, but also pictures, videos, audio, or any other binary data. Flowfile processor Performs the work which acts as a building block of data flow in NiFi. Flow controller Keeps a record of how processes are connected. It manages the threads and allocations thereof which all processes use. Web Server Web server hosts NiFi’s HTTP-based commands and API. Extension There are many types of NiFi extensions which operate and execute within the JVM. Connection Acts as a linkage between processors that contain a queue and relationship(s) which affects where data is routed. Back Pressure Stop the system of becoming overrun by controlling the quantity or data size of flow files that can be stored in the queue. Process Group A process group is a set of processes and their connections, which receives and send data with the help of ports. Flowfile Repository In the FlowFile Repository, NiFi keeps track of the state of what details it has about a given FlowFile which is active in the flow. Content Repository The Content Repository is an area where the actual content bytes of a given FlowFile exist. Provenance Repository The Provenance Repository is an area where all provenance event data is gathered. Apache NiFi Features NiFi supports buffering of all queued data and offers an ability of back pressure as those queues may reach specified limits NiFi allows the setting of one or more prioritization schemes Provides connection processors for many data sources Support any device which runs Java Ideal for limited connectivity places Support for troubleshooting and flow optimization Offers role-based authentication/authorization Allows download, recovery, and replay of individual files Build your processors, controller services, and more Provide content encryption, communication over secure protocols Enables rapid development and effective testing Allows for the development of simple single-function components that can be reused and combined to make more complex flows Allows classloader isolation for easier management of dependencies How to Install Apache NiFi Below is a step by step process for Apache NiFi installation Step 1) Go to the link, and click “Continue to Subscribe” Step 2) On the next page, Click “Accept Terms” Step 3) You will see this page, Thank you for subscribing to this product! We are processing your request. Step 4) Refresh the page after 5 minutes. Click on “Continue to Configuration” Step 5) On the next page, Keep settings default and click “Continue to Launch” Step 6) On the next page, Click on Launch. You may need to create a key Step 7) You will see this success message. Congratulations! An instance of this software is successfully deployed on EC2! Step 8) Note, The instance id and the public DNS of the EC2 instance Step 9) In the security group, Add all traffic rule to inbound and outbound Step 10) To access Nifi, simply use the URL http://publicdns:808/nifi In our case it becomes http://ec2-100-26-156-57.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/nifi/ User: admin Password: Instance Id Step 11) You will see, NiFi home screen Nifi Use Cases Below is a list of Apache NiFi use cases: Industry Usage Insurance Risk & underwriting analysis Claims Analytics Usage-based Insurance New product development HealthCare Single view of Patient Real-time vital sign monitoring EMR optimization Supply Chain Optimization Telecommunication Single view of the customer CDR analysis Dynamic Bandwidth allocation Manufacturing Preventative Maintenance Supply Chain Optimization Quality Control Oil & Gas- Industry Real-time monitoring Single view of the Operation Predictive Maintenance Archive & Analytics Unstructured data classification Financial Services Anti-money laundering Fraud- Detection Risk- data management Best practices Running Apache NiFi Ideal to separate test/dev/production environments in NiFi You should break your flow into process groups Use a naming convention, use comments and labels Organize your projects into three parts ingestion, test & monitoring Use unique names for variable Disadvantage of Nifi Need precise security and compliance controls You need to know the underlying system very well while working with Apache NiFi Must maintain chain of custody for data Transport / Messaging may not prove enough Data access needs exceed available resources to transport Not all data is created equally SSL and topic level authorization may not be sufficient Summary Apache NiFi is an open source software for automating and managing the flow of data between systems NiFi is designed to scale-out in clusters which offer guaranteed delivery of data Nifi was developed at NSA for over eight years Once data is fetched from external sources, it is represented as FlowFile inside Apache NiFi architecture. FlowFile, processor, controller, web server, connection, back pressure, repository are important components of NiFi architecture NiFi expression language supports any device which runs Java You can easily install NiFi on AWS NiFi is used in varied industries such as healthcare, insurance, telecom, manufacturing, finance, oil and gas among others As a best practice, organize your projects into three parts ingestion, test & monitoring You Might Like: SAP APO Tutorial: Full Form, Modules, SNP & Demand Planning SAP PI/PO Tutorial: What is Process Integration & Orchestration SAP BPC Tutorial: What is Business Planning and Consolidation?
