Cost â€“ SAP claims that SAP HANA Software can reduce Total IT cost of a company. Choice Option â€“ SAP HANA is supported by different hardware vendor and Software provider, so based on the requirement, the user can choose the best option. SAP HANA In-Memory Strategy SAP HANA has many processes running on the SUSE Linux Server. SUSE Linux server manages the reservation of memory to all process. When SAP HANA starts up, Linux OS reserves memory for the program code, program stack, and static data. OS can dynamically reserve additional data memory upon request from the SAP HANA Server. SAP HANA create a memory pool for managing and tracking the consumption of memory. The memory pool is used to store all the in-memory data and system tables, thread stack, temporary computations and all other data structure required for managing the database. When more memory is required for table growth or temporary computations, the SAP HANA memorymanager obtains this from the pool. For an overview, check out the Memory Overview feature of the SAP HANA studio. To access it, right-click on a System ->Configuration and Monitoring -> Open Memory Overview in the context menu, as follows: SAP HANA Advantages Below are advantages of SAP HANA â€“ By In-Memory Technology user can explore and analyze all transactional and analytic data in real time from virtually any data source. Data can be aggregated from many sources. Real-time replication services can be used to access and replicate data from SAP ERP. SQL and MDX interface from third party support. It provides information modeling and design environment. SAP HANA Compare to BWA (Business Warehouse Accelerator) SAP BW Accelerator: It is an in-memory accelerator for BW. BWA is focused on improving the query performance of SAP NetWeaver BW. BWA is specifically designed to accelerate BW queries reducing the data acquisition time by persisting copies of the infocube. SAP HANA: SAP HANA is in-memory database and platform for high-performance analytic reports and application. In SAP HANA data can be loaded from SAP and non-SAP Source System through SLT, BODS, DXC, and Sybase and can be viewed using SAP BO/BI, Crystal Reports, and Excel, etc. Currently, SAP HANA also work as in-Memory database for SAP BW, so in this way SAP HANA able to improve the overall performance of SAP Net weaver BW. What is SAP HANA Information composer? SAP HANA Information composer is a web application that allows us to do modelling and upload local data to SAP HANA database. This is Modelling environment for non-technical people like an end user. Information Composer works same as SAP HANA Modeler and used by Business user with less technical knowledge. A Large amount of data (up to 5 million of cell) can be uploaded using Information Composer. Role required for work with SAP HANA Information Composer â€“ IC_MODELLER: Used to allow the user to work with Information composer, Load data and create information view. IC_PUBLIC: Used to allow the user to work with information composer, see workbook and information views. SAP HANA SQL Expression SQL Expressions is a clause that can be used for return values. There are 4 types of SQL Expressions- Case Expressions â€“ In this expression the user can use IF â€“ THEN â€“ ELSE logic without write procedure. Function Expressions â€“ SQL built-in-functions can be used as Expressions. Aggregate Expressions â€“ In This Expression aggregate functions is used to calculate a single value from the values of multiple rows for a column. Aggregate Name Description COUNT Count the Number of rows returned by the query. MIN Return the minimum value of the expression. MAX Return the maximum value of the expression. SUM Return the sum of expressions. AVG Return the arithmetical mean of expressions. STDDEV Return the Standard Deviation of given expressions as the square root of VARIANCE function. VAR Return the variance of expressions as the square of standard deviation Subqueries in Expression â€“ A subquery is a select statement enclosed in parentheses and used in a main select statement as input. Create SQL Triggers in SAP HANA A trigger is also a stored procedure that automatically executes when an event happens on a given table or view. The database users only having the TRIGGER privilege for the given <subject_table_name> are allowed to create a trigger for that table or view. The CREATE TRIGGER command defines a set of statements that are executed when a given operation (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) takes place on a given subject table or subject view. Syntax to Create SQL Triggers CREATE TRIGGER <trigger_name>	<trigger_action_time>  <trigger_event_list>		
     ON <subject_table_name> [REFERENCING <transition_list>] 
       [<for_each_row>] 
                 BEGIN 
                           [<trigger_decl_list>]
                           [<proc_handler_list>]
	             <trigger_stmt_list>		
                 END 
 Syntax Elements to Create SQL Triggers ELEMENTS DESCRIPTION <trigger_name> It specifies the name of the trigger to be created, with the optional schema name. <trigger_action_time> BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF BEFORE â€“ Specifies that the trigger will be executed before the DML Operation on a table. AFTER â€“ Specifies that the trigger will be executed after the DML operation on a table. INSTEAD OF â€“ Specifies that the trigger will be executed instead of the DML operation on a view. A view with INSTEAD OF trigger becomes updatable. What is SAP HANA SQL Data Profiling? Data profiling is the process of analyzing the data available in an existing data source and collecting statistics and information about that data. SQL DATA profiling task is used to understand and analyze data from different data source.
