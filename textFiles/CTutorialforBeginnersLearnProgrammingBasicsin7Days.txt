Here are some prominent reasons for learning C++? C++ is a programming language close to the hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level, which gives you a lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance, and finally a robust software development. C++ programming gives you a clear understanding of Object-Oriented Programming. C++ is the most widely used programming language in application and system programming. C++ programming language teaches you the difference between compiler, linker, loader, different data types, variable types, scopes, etc. Applications of C++ Programming Here are some important applications of C++: C++ is used to develop all kinds of embedded systems like smartwatches, multimedia systems in automobiles, IoT devices, etc. C++ also allows you to develop servers and high-performance microcontroller programs C++ programming language is used for developing almost all the major Operating Systems like Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux Game development is the major application of C++. Thatâ€™s why C++ is becoming more popular among game developers. C++ is being heavily used in developing Medical and Engineering applications like software for MRI machines, high-end CAD/CAM systems, etc. Prerequisites for learning C++ Before you start learning C++ with various types of examples given in this C++ for beginners tutorial, we assume that you are already aware of the basics of a computer program and computer programming language concepts like variable, function, sequence, selection, and iteration. What will you learn in this C++ Tutorial?
