Recent Articles on Binary Search Tree ! Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree. Topic : Basic Construction and Conversion Check and Smallest/Largest Element Red Black Tree and Threaded Binary Tree Balanced Binary Search Tree Misc Basic : Binary Search Tree | Set 1 (Search and Insertion) Binary Search Tree | Set 2 (Delete) Advantages of BST over Hash Table Construction and Conversion : Construct BST from given preorder traversal | Set 1 Construct BST from given preorder traversal | Set 2 Binary Tree to Binary Search Tree Conversion Sorted Linked List to Balanced BST Sorted Array to Balanced BST Transform a BST to greater sum tree Construct all possible BSTs for keys 1 to N Convert a BST to a Binary Tree such that sum of all greater keys is added to every key BST to a Tree with sum of all smaller keys In-place Convert BST into a Min-Heap Convert BST to Min Heap Construct BST from its given level order traversal Reverse a path in BST using queue Binary Tree to Binary Search Tree Conversion using STL set Check given array of size n can represent BST of n levels or not Convert a normal BST to Balanced BST Merge Two Balanced Binary Search Trees Merge two BSTs with limited extra space Checking and Searching : Find the node with minimum value in a Binary Search Tree Check if the given array can represent Level Order Traversal of Binary Search Tree Check if a given array can represent Preorder Traversal of Binary Search Tree Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Search Tree A program to check if a binary tree is BST or not Find k-th smallest element in BST (Order Statistics in BST) Check if each internal node of a BST has exactly one child Check for Identical BSTs without building the trees K’th Largest Element in BST when modification to BST is not allowed K’th Largest element in BST using constant extra space Second largest element in BST K’th smallest element in BST using O(1) Extra Space Check if given sorted sub-sequence exists in binary search tree Simple Recursive solution to check whether BST contains dead end Check if an array represents Inorder of Binary Search tree or not Check if two BSTs contain same set of elements Largest number in BST which is less than or equal to N Maximum Unique Element in every subarray of size K Iterative searching in Binary Search Tree Find distance between two nodes of a Binary Search Tree Count pairs from two BSTs whose sum is equal to a given value x Find median of BST in O(n) time and O(1) space Largest BST in a Binary Tree | Set 2 Remove BST keys outside the given range Print BST keys in the given range Print BST keys in given Range | O(1) Space Count BST nodes that lie in a given range Count BST subtrees that lie in given range Remove all leaf nodes from the binary search tree Sum of k smallest elements in BST Inorder Successor in Binary Search Tree Inorder predecessor and successor for a given key in BST Inorder predecessor and successor for a given key in BST | Iterative Approach Find if there is a triplet in a Balanced BST that adds to zero Find a pair with given sum in a Balanced BST Find a pair with given sum in BST Maximum element between two nodes of BST Find pairs with given sum such that pair elements lie in different BSTs Find the closest element in Binary Search Tree Find the largest BST subtree in a given Binary Tree Replace every element with the least greater element on its right Add all greater values to every node in a given BST Red Black Tree and Threaded Binary Tree : C Program for Red Black Tree Insertion Left Leaning Red Black Tree (Insertion) Threaded Binary Tree Threaded Binary Tree | Insertion Threaded Binary Search Tree | Deletion Convert a Binary Tree to Threaded binary tree | Set 1 (Using Queue) Convert a Binary Tree to Threaded binary tree | Set 2 (Efficient) Inorder Non-threaded Binary Tree Traversal without Recursion or Stack Balanced Binary Search Tree : Convert a normal BST to Balanced BST Sorted Array to Balanced BST Sorted Linked List to Balanced BST How to determine if a binary tree is height-balanced?
