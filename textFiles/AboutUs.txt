Over the years, the cost of education has increased many folds to make it beyond the reach of many. You may be appalled to learn that even in most developed nations students resort to prostitution to pay up for their college tuition fees. We want to remove this financial barrier to a good education. The only barrier to education must be an individual’s thirst for knowledge. Our Vision Fun & Free Education for ALL Our Founder Krishna loves technology and always had a flair for teaching. Guru99 was born after his many iterations to make education easily accessible and fun. In his current role, he oversees the 360 operations of the company, leading a dedicated and committed team who share our vision. In his free time, he loves to learn about new technology and play with his kids. Get in Touch We have a presence in all popular social channels.
