Answer: Math is one of the subjects that many students are afraid of. However, if you create interest via continuous practice, you will ultimately master it. Trying to transition from Class 10 to Class 11 in math, particularly in CBSE, is tough since the pattern and type of questions change. Because students are inexperienced with these new concepts, this frequently results in a drop in internal scores. Keeping on to new theories and concepts takes some time. You can only get through this change with practice. Chapters such as trigonometry, permutation, and combination may appear difficult at first, but with practice, they will become easy. Question 2: Which book is best for Class 11 Maths? Answer: No book, however, can replace the NCERT Class 11 Maths textbook. This is your bible, and you must keep it with you at all times. NCERT provides over half of the question paper, and all competitive exams are based on NCERT. However, once you’ve finished with NCERT, you can move on to RS Agarwal’s Senior Secondary School Mathematics: for Class 11 and RD Sharma’s Mathematics for Class 11. Question 3: What are some important tips for Class 11 final examinations to score good marks? Answer: Students in Class 11 must study for their home examinations as well as competitive tests (IIT-JEE, BITS PILANI, etc.). NCERT Solutions provide a step-by-step application of all Solutions, ensuring that students learn how to write an exam and achieve the highest possible result. It also includes tips and tricks for solving complex problems in seconds, which are very valuable for competitive exams. Students can use the NCERT Solutions to quickly and efficiently revise their complete syllabus. Because students do not have enough time to complete all of the problems on exam days, they can review the Solutions and memorize all of the key concepts, theorems, and formulas needed to attempt similar questions. As a result, they are relaxed and confident during the exam.
