The task is to make all the array elements equal to zero by applying the minimum number of operations. Following operations are allowed: Select an index i and decrease each element by 1 for the prefix up to that index. Select an index i and decrease each element by 1 for the suffix starting from that index. Increase all the elements of the array by 1. Examples: Input: arr[] = {2, 4, 6, 3, 7} Output: Minimum operations: 12 Explanation: Select Index 0, and decrease all the elements from index 1 to 4 by 2 in 2 operations, new arr[] would be {2, 2, 4, 1, 5}. Select Index 1, and decrease all the elements from index 2 to 4 by 2 in 2 operations, new arr[] would be {2, 2, 2, -1, 3} Select Index 3, and decrease all the elements from index 0 to 2 by 3 in 3 operations, new arr[] would be {-1, -1, -1, -1, 3} Select Index 3, and decrease element of index 4 by 4 in 4 operations, New arr[] would be {-1, -1, -1, -1, -1} Increase all the elements by 1 in 1 operation, Final arr[] would be {0, 0, 0, 0, 0} Total, operations would be 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 12 Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 5, 2, 8} Output: Minimum operations: 21 Approach: The following problem can be solved using Greedy Approach. Initially make all elements equal to the first element and then decrement them to have value as 0. To do this following steps can be taken: For making all the elements equal to the first element, we will use the difference between the consecutive elements. ( arr[i+1] – arr[i] ). If the difference (diff = arr[i+1] – arr[i]) is positive, decrease the elements of suffix starting from index (i+1). Number of operations required = abs( diff ) If the difference (diff = arr[i+1] – arr[i]) is negative, decrease the elements of prefix up to index i. Number of operations required = abs( diff ) . Decreasing the prefix will also decrease the first element of the array by abs( diff). Finally, the total number of required operations will be operations calculated through the absolute difference between the consecutive elements of the array plus the absolute value of the first element of the array. Below is the implementation of the above approach: C++14 // C++ code to implement the approach #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function to find minimum number of // operations required to make all // array elements zero int minimumOperations(int arr[], int n) { int i; // It will count total no. of operations int operations = 0; for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) { // Calculate the difference and // add its absolute value to // the no. of operations operations += abs(arr[i + 1] - arr[i]); // If the changes are done in prefix // then update first element of array if (arr[i + 1] - arr[i] < 0) { arr[0] -= (abs(arr[i + 1] - arr[i])); } } // Now all the elements of the array are // equal to arr[0], add absolute value // of arr[0] to the no. of operations operations += abs(arr[0]); // Return the total number of operations return operations; } // Driver code int main() { int arr[] = { 2, 4, 6, 3, 7 }; int N = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); // Function call cout << "Minimum operations: " << minimumOperations(arr, N); return 0; } Output Minimum operations: 12 Time Complexity: O(N) Auxiliary Space: O(1) My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Like Previous Maximum possible difference between two Subarrays after removing N elements from Array Recommended Articles Page : Minimize increment or increment and decrement of Pair to make all Array elements equal 14, Mar 22 Count of suffix increment/decrement operations to construct a given array 10, Dec 17 Minimum increment and decrement by K of each pair elements required to make all array elements equal 31, Jan 21 Minimum increment or decrement operations required to make the array sorted 15, Oct 19 Minimum increment/decrement operations required to make Median as X 02, Jul 20 Minimum Increment / decrement to make array elements equal 15, Nov 18 Minimum number of increment/decrement operations such that array contains all elements from 1 to N 28, Nov 18 Minimize increment or decrement operations to make given Array elements consecutive 12, Jan 22 Minimize absolute difference between the smallest and largest array elements by minimum increment decrement operations 28, Jun 21 Minimum increment/decrement operations required on Array to satisfy given conditions 19, Aug 20 Minimize increment/decrement of Array elements to make each modulo K equal 31, Jul 20 Minimum increment/decrement to make array non-Increasing 20, May 18 Minimum decrement operations to make Array elements equal by only decreasing K each time 04, Feb 20 Construct array B as last element left of every suffix array obtained by performing given operations on every suffix of given array 20, Jul 21 Minimum number of increment-other operations to make all array elements equal. 05, Oct 17 Minimum increment by k operations to make all elements equal 04, Mar 18 Minimum increment or decrement required to sort the array | Top-down Approach 09, Apr 20 Maximize frequency of an element by at most one increment or decrement of all array elements 08, Dec 20 Maximize frequency of an element by at most one increment or decrement of all array elements | Set 2 10, Nov 21 Making elements of two arrays same with minimum increment/decrement 05, May 18 Count of indices in Array having all prefix elements less than all in suffix 10, Mar 22 Minimum increment operations to make K elements equal 17, Sep 19 Count of indices up to which prefix and suffix sum is equal for given Array 30, Nov 21 Increment odd positioned elements by 1 and decrement even positioned elements by 1 in an Array 01, Apr 19 Article Contributed By : agrawalbhavya3113 @agrawalbhavya3113 Vote for difficulty Easy Normal Medium Hard Expert Article Tags : Arrays Greedy Practice Tags : Arrays Greedy Report Issue Writing code in comment?
